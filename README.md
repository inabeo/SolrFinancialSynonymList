# SolrFinancialSynonymList
Solr synonym list for financial institutions
# Introduction
The goal is to create a synonym list for economic & financial information that can be shared for the dissemination of statistics.

The synonym list will be created via two channels: 
1. Referential metadata registry (e.g. SDMX code lists) where elements such as country and currency names can be matched with their code abreviations
2. Business metadata refers to business terms that are similar in meaning
